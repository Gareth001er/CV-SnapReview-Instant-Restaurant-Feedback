# SnapReview: Instant Restaurant Feedback

Problem Statement

When people are out walking, driving, or exploring new areas they often come across restaurants that catch their eye. 
However, the process of manually typing in a restaurant's name to look up reviews can be  inconvenient and can deter immediate decision-making. 
SnapReview solves this by enabling users to simply take a photo of a restaurantâ€™s storefront.
Using computer vision and OCR, the app instantly identifies the restaurant and provides real-time access to ratings and reviews from platforms like Yelp or Google.

   Restaurant owners who may receive more exposure due to improved access to reviews

 Development Stakeholders:
Computer vision and mobile app developers

 SMART Goal

Specific: Build a mobile application that can recognize restaurant names from storefront images and retrieve relevant reviews.
